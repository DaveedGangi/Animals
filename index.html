<ul>
    
    <li>The name panda comes from the Nepali word called “poonya,” which means bamboo eater</li>
    <li> Although they spend most of the time on trees, they may descend to the ground to dig out roots and grass to eat when they are very hungry. </li>
    <li>There are less than 10,000 red pandas left in the wild, and their numbers are slowly declining.  </li>
    <li>Red Pandas sleep for long hours during the day.They are usually solitary creatures and become active at night.  </li>
    <li>Red panda goes by other several English names, the most popular ones being firefox, fire cat, and red cat. Some scientific researchers also refer to the animal as the lesser panda.  </li>

        <P>Lion</P>
        <ul>
            <li> Lions are famous for their loud roar which can be heard up to 5 miles away. They can make such a loud roar because the cartilage in their throats has turned into bone. They tend to roar more at night.</li>
            <li>The lion is taller than the tiger, but doesn't weigh as much. </li>
            <li>They are excellent swimmers. </li>
            <li>Even though the female lions do the hunting, the male lion often gets to eat first. </li>
            <li> Lions will live about 15 years in the wild.

                <ul>
                    <li> As the largest land mammal on the planet, an average male elephant can be measured up to three meters high (or 13 feet)  and weighing up to six tonnes. Elephants also have large brains – they weigh about 4-6kg and are the largest for terrestrial mammals. Those that live in the wild can grow to be 60-70 years old. .</li>
                    <li>Here’s one of the more interesting facts about elephants: they can communicate with their feet </li>
                    <li>Despite being the largest land mammal on the planet, Elephants’ entire diet consists of roots, grasses, fruits, and bark. However, it’s the sheer volume of them that helps the animal get to their size. An adult elephant can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day.  </li>
